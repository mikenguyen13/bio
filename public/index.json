Today, we’re going to embark on a journey that will take us from a scattered mess of .R files to the organized, efficient world of R packages. Why, you ask? Well, let me tell you a story.\nOnce upon a time, I was just like you. I had a bunch of utility functions scattered across numerous .R files. Every time I needed a function I wrote months, weeks, or even days ago, I had to embark on a treasure hunt through my files. More often than not, I ended up re-writing the function because it was faster than searching for it. Sound familiar?\nWell, I finally decided it was time to take the next step and start wrapping all my utility functions into R packages. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer. Here’s why:\nEfficiency: Having your own R package can significantly speed up your workflow. Instead of re-writing the same functions over and over again, you can simply call them from your package. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency in your analyses.\nReproducibility: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of good research. With an R package, you can ensure that your analyses are reproducible and transparent. This is especially important when collaborating with others or when your work is subject to peer review.\nLearning and Development: Creating your own R package is a great way to deepen your understanding of R and programming principles. It encourages good practices such as writing clear, concise code and thorough documentation.\rSharing and Collaboration: R packages are an excellent way to share your work and collaborate with others. By making your code available as a package, you make it easy for others to use and build upon your work. This can lead to collaborations and advancements that you may not have achieved on your own.\rCareer Advancement: Having your own R package can be a significant feather in your cap professionally. It demonstrates your proficiency in R and your ability to create reusable, efficient code. This can be a great selling point in job interviews or grant applications.\nCustomization: With your own R package, you can create functions tailored to your specific needs. For example, if you’re a marketing researcher, you might create a function that generates plots in the style required by the American Marketing Association, like this:\n#\u0026#39; @export\ramatheme \u0026lt;- function() {\rggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 14, base_family = \u0026quot;serif\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::theme(\rpanel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(),\rpanel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),\rline = ggplot2::element_line(),\rtext = ggplot2::element_text(),\rlegend.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(0.6), face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\rlegend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(0.6)),\rlegend.background = ggplot2::element_rect(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = ggplot2::element_text(\rsize = ggplot2::rel(1.2),\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rhjust = 0.5,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(b = 15)\r),\rplot.margin = ggplot2::unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;),\raxis.line = ggplot2::element_line(colour = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, linewidth = 0.8),\raxis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(),\raxis.title.x = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(1.2), face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\raxis.title.y = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(1.2), face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\raxis.text.y = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(1)),\raxis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(size = ggplot2::rel(1))\r)\r}\rThis function creates a custom ggplot2 theme that complies with the American Marketing Association style. With this function in your R package, you can easily generate plots that are ready for your next marketing paper.\nBut the beauty of R packages is that they’re not just for marketing researchers. Anyone can use them. For example, you can check out my own package on GitHub. To install it, simply run:\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;mikenguyen13/mikenguyen\u0026quot;)\rFeel free to use it for your research, whether you’re in marketing, science, or just a data enthusiast like me.\nSo, are you ready to dive into the world of R packages? Great! Let’s get started.\nSetting Up\rFirst things first, we need to install a couple of packages that will make our lives easier: devtools and roxygen2. You can install them using the following commands:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;)\rinstall.packages(\u0026quot;roxygen2\u0026quot;)\rCreating the Framework for Your First Package\rNow that we have our tools, we can start building the framework for our package. We can do this using devtools:\ndevtools::create(\u0026quot;myfirstpackage\u0026quot;)\rThis command creates a folder with the same name as your package name and populates it with a few files. For now, we’ll focus on the DESCRIPTION file (where all the meta-data about your package goes) and the R folder (where all your R code goes).\nAdding Your R Functions\rAll your R functions that you want in your R package belong in the R directory. You can create an .R file that has the same name as the function you want in it. For instance, let’s create a file called R/amatheme.R and add our function to it.\nRemember to add the #’ @export tag above the function. This tag indicates that the function should be “exposed” to users to use.\nLet’s say we have a function amatheme that we want to include in our package. We would create a new .R file in the R directory of our package, let’s call it amatheme.R. In this file, we would define our function:\n#\u0026#39; @export\ramatheme \u0026lt;- function() {\r# Function body goes here\r}\rDocumenting Your Functions\rNow, let’s talk about documentation. You know when you type ?amatheme in R and get that nice documentation? That’s what we’re going to do next. We can leverage off the roxygen2 package to document our functions.\nTo document our amatheme function, we would add special comments above the function definition in the amatheme.R file:\n#\u0026#39; Title of the function\r#\u0026#39;\r#\u0026#39; @description A detailed description of what the function does.\r#\u0026#39; @param param1 Description of the first parameter.\r#\u0026#39; @param param2 Description of the second parameter.\r#\u0026#39; @return Description of the return value.\r#\u0026#39; @examples #\u0026#39; example1\r#\u0026#39; example2\r#\u0026#39; @export\ramatheme \u0026lt;- function(param1, param2) {\r# Function body goes here\r}\rOnce you’ve got your documentation completed, you can run devtools::document() to generate the .Rd files.\nPackage Documentation\rOne of the key aspects of creating an R package is documentation. Good documentation is crucial for ensuring that others can understand and use your package. This includes not only commenting your code but also creating help files for each function and a detailed package vignette.\nTo create a vignette for our package, we would use the usethis::use_vignette(\"introduction\") function. This creates a template R Markdown file in the vignettes directory of our package. We can edit this file to provide a detailed introduction to our package.\nA package vignette is a long-form guide that provides a comprehensive overview of your package. It typically includes an introduction to the package, detailed examples of how to use each function, and any other information that users might need to understand your package.\nDependencies\rWhen creating an R package, it’s important to carefully manage your package dependencies. These are other R packages that your package relies on. You should aim to minimize your dependencies to reduce the likelihood of conflicts and errors. When you do need to use other packages, make sure to specify them in the Imports field of your DESCRIPTION file.\nFor example, if our package depends on ggplot2, we would add the following line to the DESCRIPTION file:\nImports:\rggplot2\rData\rIf you want to include raw data files (like .csv, .tsv, .txt, etc.) in your R package, you should place them in the inst/extdata directory of your package. This is a standard location for storing raw data in R packages.\nHere’s how you can use such data:\nAdd your raw data file to the inst/extdata directory in your package. For example, you might add a file called model-coef.rds.\nAfter installing your package, you can access the data file using the system.file() function. Here’s how you can do it:\ndata_file_path \u0026lt;- system.file(\u0026quot;extdata\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;model-coef.rds\u0026quot;, package = \u0026quot;myfirstpackage\u0026quot;)\rdata \u0026lt;- readRDS(data_file_path)\rIn this example, system.file() generates the full system path to the data file within the installed package. Then readRDS() is used to read the data into R.\nRemember, the inst directory in an R package is for “installed files” - these are files that are not R code or data, but which should be included with the package. The contents of the inst directory are copied by R into the root of the package when it is installed, which is why you don’t include inst in the path when using system.file().\nRules of Thumb and Industry Hacks\rHere are a few rules of thumb and industry hacks to keep in mind when creating your R package:\nKeep it simple: Try to keep your package focused on one task or theme. This makes it easier for others to understand what your package does and how to use it.\nUse meaningful function names: Your function names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention. This makes it easier for users to understand what each function does.\nTest your package: Make sure to thoroughly test your package before releasing it. This includes checking that all functions work as expected and that all documentation is clear and accurate.\nKeep learning: Creating an R package is a learning process. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes and keep improving your package over time.\n# Alway remember to devtools::document()\rusethis::use_test(\u0026quot;yournewfunction\u0026quot;)\rput export(yournewfunction) and import(needed_package) in NAMESPACE file\nput the packages requirements under Import: in DESCRIPTION file\nput an example of the function in the Vignette file\nInstalling and Using Your R Package\rSo, we’ve got our functions, we’ve got our documentation, what’s next? It’s time to install and use our package! We can use the devtools::install() function to install our R package into our R system library. Then we can load up our package with library(\"myfirstpackage\").\nDistributing Your R Package\rNow that we’ve got our shiny new R package, how do we share it with the world? The easiest way is to distribute it through GitHub.\nTo distribute our package on GitHub, we first need to create a new repository on GitHub. Then, we can use Git to commit our package files and push them to the GitHub repository. Here’s an example of how to do this in the terminal:\n# Navigate to the directory of your package\rcd path/to/your/package\r# Initialize a new Git repository\rgit init\r# Add all files in the directory to the Git repository\rgit add .\r# Commit the files\rgit commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot;\r# Add the GitHub repository as a remote\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git\r# Push the files to the GitHub repository\rgit push -u origin master\rOnce you’ve pushed your package to GitHub, anyone can install it using the following command:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;yourusername/myfirstpackage\u0026quot;)\rAnd that’s it! You’ve successfully created, documented, installed, and distributed your very own R package. But wait, there’s more! You can also check out my own package on GitHub. To install it, simply run:\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;mikenguyen13/mikenguyen\u0026quot;)\rFeel free to use it for your research, whether you’re in marketing, science, or just a data enthusiast like me.

Hence, if members want to use this function, they typically have to apply for permission to use the “Make Me Admin” app, which grants administrator rights for 15 minutes. This movement can seriously hinder the working process and speed. But it seems unstoppable now (i.e., an industry-wide adoption). Hence, before installing programs on your computer, you will always need to run this app first. Or else, when being asked for admin privileges, your username and password will not suffice.\nMoreover, another movement is where organizations only use cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox, Box, OneDrive) instead of purchasing physical hard drives. Hence, your home default directory might be changed and cause unintended consequences (e.g., disintegration between GitHub and Rstudio). For example, my organization recently implemented an org-wide integration with OneDrive. Hence, my default home directory was changed from C:\\Users\\tn9k4\\Documents\\ to C:\\Users\\tn9k4\\OneDrive - University of Missouri\\Documents. This change disrupts my configuration between GitHub and Rstudio.\nI can still manually push, pull, and do various things with GitHub, but only via manually coding. The Git tab in Rstudio is missing in Rstudio on Windows computers.\nI’ve tried to reinstall Git, Rstudio, and reset the Rstudio settings.\rI successfully cloned a repo from GitHub, but the tab would not appear.\rAnd my terminal inside Rstudio looks like a normal Window Terminal (not like that of Git Terminal).\rIn my Global Options, my Git executable and SSH RSA key are working well.\rAnd none of the above solutions works.\nHence, a manual modification is required to fix this hiccup.\nFirst, we have to come back to the basics. We search for the Git on your machine. On Windows: where git On Linux \u0026amp; Mac: which git For me, I have three directories:\nC:\\Users\\tn9k4\\scoop\\shims\\git.exe\nC:\\Users\\tn9k4\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exe\nC:\\Users\\tn9k4\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe\nGo to Tools -\u0026gt; Global Options -\u0026gt; Git/SVN, change the “Git executable” to the second path (C:\\Users\\tn9k4\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe). The first is installed with Scoop, and your Rstudio cannot recognize it.\nSearch on your Windows Search bar, “edit the system environment variables,” click on “Environment Variables”. Then click on “PATH” under the user variable (not the system variable). Add your bin path (e.g., C:/Users/tn9k4/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/bin)\nReset and Reopen your Rstudio; you should be able to see your Git tab now.\nAll of the problems stem from installing only to my user directory since I don’t have admin privileges yet.\nTo avoid these mambo jumbos, an alternative way is that you can simply uninstall git and scoop and reinstall Git with admin privileges.\nSearch for “Add or remove programs” in your Windows search bar. Then, uninstall “Git.”\rIn “Terminal”, execute scoop uninstall scoop\rThen download Git 64 Standalone Installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win (use the version according to your computer). When opening the installer, right-click to “Run as Admin,” then you have the option to install it in C:\\Program Files\\ Remember to pick “Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt” and “Enable Symbolic Links.”\rOpen “Rstudio” with “Run as Admin”, go to Tools -\u0026gt; Global Options -\u0026gt; Terminal -\u0026gt; New terminal open with -\u0026gt; Select “Git Bash”\rVoila!

Equivalently, (share price multiplied by number of shares) over (common stock equity, capital surplus, and retained earnings).\nMarket-to-book ratio and Tobin’s q have been shown to be equivalent measures (Chung and Pruitt 1994)\nOriginal Tobin’s q calculation (Lindenberg and Ross 1981)\n\\[\rq = \\frac{PREFST + VCOMS + LTDEBT + STDEBT - ADJ}{TOTASST - BKCAP + NETCAP}\r\\]\nwhere\nPREFST is the liquidating value of a firm’s preferred stock.\nVCOMS is the price of the firm’s common stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding at year end (December 31st).\nLTDEBT is the long-term debt adjusted for its age structure\rSTDEBT is the book value of the firm’s current liabilities\nADJ is the net short-term assets\nTOTASST is the book value of the firm’s total assets\nBKCAP is the book value of the firm’s net capital stock\nNETCAP is information-adjusted net capital stock.\rHowever, (Chung and Pruitt 1994) have proposed a simple reliable, and tractable approximation of Tobin’s q:\n\\[\rq = \\frac{MVE + PS + DEBT}{TA}\r\\]\nwhere\nMVE = share price x number of common stock share outstanding\rPS = liquidating value of outstanding preferred stock\nDEBT = short-term liability - short-term assets + book value of long-term debt\nTA is the book value of the total assets.\r(Chung and Pruitt 1994) method assumes that the replacement values of a firm’s plant, equipment, and inventories equal to their book values.\nApplication\rRetrieve data from WRDS\n# to set up connection from R to WRDS (https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-r/r-from-your-computer/)\rlibrary(RPostgres)\rlibrary(dplyr)\r# I\u0026#39;ve set up wrds connection before hand.
