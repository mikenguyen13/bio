In each section, books are listed in a recommended reading order.

I do not endorse any bookseller. I try my best to find sources that are not a bookseller. But sometimes, Google Books does not have that books yet.

Please enjoy!!!

**Note**: my book recommendations do not reflect the viewpoints of any of my affiliated organizations, but mine alone.
