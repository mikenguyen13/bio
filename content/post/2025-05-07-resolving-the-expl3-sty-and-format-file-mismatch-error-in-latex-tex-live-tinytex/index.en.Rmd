If you're encountering the following LaTeX error when compiling a Bookdown or Quarto PDF document:

```
! LaTeX Error: Mismatched LaTeX support files detected.
(LaTeX)        Loading 'expl3.sty' aborted!
(LaTeX)        The L3 programming layer in the LaTeX format
(LaTeX)        is dated 2025-03-26, but in your TeX tree the files require
(LaTeX)        at least 2025-04-14.
```

You're not alone. This issue typically arises from a partial or inconsistent update to your LaTeX distribution — especially with **TeX Live** or **TinyTeX** — where the base format files (`*.fmt`) are out of sync with newer packages like `expl3.sty`.

This blog post offers a **comprehensive, step-by-step fix**, especially for Windows users, and documents solutions to every roadblock you may hit — from missing binaries to Perl errors and administrative permissions.

---

## Problem Summary

LaTeX is complaining because the date of the internal format (e.g., `latex.fmt`) is **older than what updated packages expect**. This happens when:

* You run `tlmgr update --all`, but it doesn’t regenerate format files.
* You update only parts of TinyTeX or TeX Live.
* You switch between different LaTeX installations (e.g., TinyTeX + full TeX Live).

---

## Quick Fix Summary

> If you're an expert and want the short answer:

```sh
# In Windows Command Prompt (Run as Administrator)
perl C:\texlive\2025\texmf-dist\scripts\texlive\fmtutil.pl --sys --all
```

But chances are you’ll hit several issues before getting this to work. Read on for the full guide.

## Step-by-Step Solution (for Windows + TeX Live 2025)

### Step 1: Confirm the Error

In R or Quarto, your error log will say:

```r
Error: LaTeX failed to compile data_analysis.tex. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging
```

### Step 2: Check Version Mismatch

From a terminal:

```cmd
kpsewhich expl3.sty
```

Then inspect the header of that file:

```latex
%% File: expl3.sty 2025-04-14
```

If your LaTeX format is older (e.g., 2025-03-26), you have a mismatch.

### Step 3: Try Updating TeX Live

```cmd
tlmgr update --self --all
```

This updates packages, but **does not rebuild the formats**. Hence, the problem remains.

### Step 4: Rebuild Format Files Manually

This is where most people get stuck.

Try:

```cmd
fmtutil-sys --all
```

But you might get this:

```
'kpsewhich' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

### Step 5: Fix `kpsewhich` and PATH Issues

Ensure TeX Live's binaries are in your PATH:

Add this to your environment variables:

```
C:\texlive\2025\bin\windows
```

Then restart your Command Prompt and verify:

```cmd
where kpsewhich
```

Should return:

```
C:\texlive\2025\bin\windows\kpsewhich.exe
```

### Step 6: Use a Valid Perl Interpreter

TeX Live relies on Perl scripts like `fmtutil.pl`, but many Windows users:

* Don’t have Perl
* Have the wrong Perl (e.g., Rtools)

Install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) — use the `.msi` version.

After installation:

```cmd
where perl
```

Ensure it returns:

```
C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
```

If it still shows Rtools Perl (`C:\rtools44\usr\bin\perl.exe`), reorder your system `PATH` so that `Strawberry\perl\bin` comes first.

### Step 7: Run the Fix

Now you're ready. In **Administrator Command Prompt**, run:

```cmd
set PATH=C:\texlive\2025\bin\windows;%PATH% && perl C:\texlive\2025\texmf-dist\scripts\texlive\fmtutil.pl --sys --all
```

This rebuilds all format files (57 in total). Success will look like:

```
[INFO]: successfully rebuilt formats: 54
[INFO]: exiting with status 0
```

---

## Common Errors and Their Fixes

### `'kpsewhich' is not recognized`

Add `C:\texlive\2025\bin\windows` to your PATH.

### `'perl.exe' not recognized`

Install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/), **not** Rtools Perl.

### `Can't locate Win32/Shortcut.pm`

Run:

```cmd
cpan Win32::Shortcut
```

### `Permission denied to create temp directory`

Run the command as Administrator.

---

## Final Test

Once the formats are rebuilt, return to R or Quarto:

```r
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book")
```

This should now compile without errors.

---

## Notes for TinyTeX Users

If you use `tinytex::install_tinytex()`, you can also try:

```r
tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()
```

This wipes and reinstalls TinyTeX, usually resolving the mismatch. However, it may still miss `Win32::Shortcut.pm`, so you might need to install Strawberry Perl anyway for advanced fixes.

---

## Save Yourself the Trouble Next Time

Create a `.bat` file with this content:

```bat
@echo off
set PATH=C:\texlive\2025\bin\windows;%PATH%
perl C:\texlive\2025\texmf-dist\scripts\texlive\fmtutil.pl --sys --all
pause
```

Right-click → **Run as Administrator** whenever you update TeX Live.

---

## Closing Thoughts

This issue is a perfect storm of LaTeX ecosystem complexity:

* TeX Live doesn’t auto-rebuild format files
* Windows doesn’t ship Perl
* `tlmgr` updates break things if not followed up with `fmtutil`
* PATH precedence is fragile

By following the steps above, you ensure your LaTeX system remains consistent and stable — and your academic PDF documents continue compiling smoothly.
