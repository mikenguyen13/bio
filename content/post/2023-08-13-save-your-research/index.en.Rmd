### My 2 Cents on Sharing Your Research (Or How Not to Get Lost in the Data Jungle)

Sharing research data is like hosting a party. You want everything to be in the right place, accessible to everyone, but not too chaotic. Let's navigate the data jungle together, shall we?

### Possible Data Repositories

-   [**Harvard Dataverse**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/): Great if you're a minimalist, with a cap of 1TB per researcher. Supports only JSON and XML, so it's like a party with a strict dress code.

-   [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/): The friendly neighbor who never says no. Unlimited space, supports everything, and even merged with Dryad.

-   [**Dryad**](https://datadryad.org/): Must involve your institution. It's like needing a chaperone for a night out.

-   [**Figshare**](https://figshare.com/category): Got categories? Figshare is the librarian of data sharing.

-   [**Mendeley Data**](https://data.mendeley.com/): Like a sophisticated social club for data enthusiasts.

-   [**OSF**](https://osf.io/): If data repositories had a welcoming committee, OSF would be it.

-   [**VIVLI**](https://vivli.org/): The specialized clinic for clinical research data. Not for the faint of heart!

-   [**F1000Research**](https://f1000research.com/): It's there if you need it. Kind of like your in-laws.

If you're the indecisive type and need a full-on spreadsheet to make your life choices, here's a [comparison chart](https://www.agu.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Generalist-Data-Repository-Grid.pdf).

### Sharing Tips (or How to be the Life of the Data Party)

-   **For Datasets**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is your buffet table of unlimited choices. [More on Zenodo & Dryad's merger](https://blog.zenodo.org/2020/03/10/dryad-and-zenodo-our-path-ahead/).

-   **For Presentations**: [f1000research](https://f1000research.com/), where slide decks go to party. No limit means the dance floor is always open.

    -   If you want to share everything (e.g., data, slides, posters, etc.) in one place (i.e., project), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/category) is your best bet (but it's just not my personal favorite).

-   **For Code or Procedures**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) again! They're like that friend who's good at everything. Even better, publish your documentation as an article on the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) (my personal favorite) or the [Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles)

### The Last Crumb

Remember, these repositories are like different rooms at a party. They all come with a DOI and support an embargo period (that's the bouncer keeping things under control). Choose wisely, or you might end up in the metaphorical coatroom of the data-sharing party.

Happy sharing and don't get lost in the data jungle!
